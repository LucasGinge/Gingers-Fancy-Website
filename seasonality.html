            When something is “in season”, it is at its natural peak. For example tomatoes, strawberries, and peppers are all in season during warmer times. These plants require a lot of sun to produce their fruits, so they’re in season during the summer. Other plants, like a lot of root vegetables, require lots of water, cooler air, sometimes even frost, meaning they are naturally available during the winter, after it has rained a lot. Some plants require a long growing period, with a long, sustained period of sun, combined with a lot of water, and will generally be available to us during the autumn, like pumpkins.<br><br>
            All of this means that growers can take advantage of natural weather patterns to produce their crops. In doing so they negate the need to introduce costly technology/chemicals to produce food, and, as such, the produce can be made and purchased for lower price.<br><br>
            Under natural growing circumstances, the produce is also more wholesome. A tomato sprouted in a greenhouse and then intensively grown under UV lights and/or pumped with chemicals to increase yield, or speed up growth, will have a lower nutrient value than one that has been grown in a natural environment, at a pace suiting nature. And anyone who has tried a strawberry at the height of the British summer has experienced the benefit in taste that is a consequence of seasonality.<br><br>

            THE HISTORY OF CULTIVATION<br><br>

            Homo sapiens have been around for roughly 300,000 years. For the majority of that time, our species has survived using a “hunter gatherer” lifestyle. Whatever was available in the locality at any given time made up the diet. This could be migrating herds of animals. Or berries growing on a nearby bush.<br><br>
            This was the case until around 12,000 years ago, when humans domesticated plants. This happened in the Middle East, modern day Iraq, in an area known as Mesopotamia. This change in human behaviour is known as the “Neolithic Revolution”, Neolithic meaning New Stone (a reference to the new stone tools). The tools and artefacts found in this area from around this period became more sophisticated. This is because humans were now farming, and producing surplus food.<br><br>
            Producing surplus food meant people could exchange that food for other things they may need, like clothing, protection, or services. This introduced “specialisation”, whereby one family in a village may produce fruit for their tribe, while another family makes clothing. Another may specialise in animal husbandry, and another family constructs huts. Because people didn’t need to be survival all-rounders, they could concentrate on specialising in one sole task, becoming experts, and introducing newer, more sophisticated tools and techniques. Basically, they had invented jobs. And by becoming specialised, producing surplus crops, and building more solid shelter, they had also invented permanent settlements.<br><br>
            This phenomena created an exponential growth in human production and endeavour, and is the foundation for all of modern civilisation. The system may have become more complex, but we still have the same basic functions. We work (do our bit) in order to get the things we need to survive.<br><br>
            Over time, farmers learned to manipulate the genetic make-up of crops, artificially selecting certain factors (yield, colour, flavour) to introduce new crops or diversify a species (think of all the different species of apples, which have one common ancestor known to us as Malus sieversii, originating in what we now call Kazakhstan.) <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5Qly-VQfbo" style="text-decoration: none; color: rgb(248, 165, 134);">*This video*</a> provides a fantastic collection of the artificial selection throughout history in some of today's most popular fruits/vegetables.<br><br>
            There are certain plants that have been diversified to such an extent that they have sub-species that are seasonal at different times of the year. This has given us an abundance of choice when we buy our food. Seasonality does not require a significant sacrifice. It just requires a little thought, to make those choices the right choices.<br><br>
            Farming techniques have developed to such an extent that we can produce and share pretty much any crop, at any time, with anyone in our tribe, which has now become the world. This requires huge amounts of machinery, chemicals, fuel for transportation, and time, all of which comes at a massive cost. Agricultural pollution in the form of methane, carbon dioxide, and chemicals is contributing to the destruction of natural habitats.<br><br>
            Choosing seasonality as a contributing factor to our eating decisions, will give us food that is tastier, more nutrient-dense, and doesn’t cost us the Earth (both figuratively, and literally).<br><br>
            We need to be more sustainable. We need to consume food that is produced locally, without so many harmful, artificial contributors.
            We need to go SEASONAL.
