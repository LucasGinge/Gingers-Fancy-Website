            BUTTER<br><br>
            
            Butter has many uses in the kitchen. Chief amongst them is caramelising meat/fish. At high enough heat, the lactose sugar in butter caramelises and will add colour and flavour to the contents of your pan. Another benefit of butter is that by adding it to a hot pan, you cause the milk in the butter to steam. So you’re not just frying/sautéing, you are also steaming your food. Thirdly, Butter is a great thickener/emulsifier. We call it “mounting” in the industry, or monté in French. As a sauce or jus is just about ready, chuck in a knob of butter and mix it through the sauce to thicken it and give it a glossy sheen.

            CURING<br><br>
            
            Curing means to remove water. Doing so extends the life of our food as the reduced moisture prevents bacteria build up. But you don’t have to cure something heavily for weeks like you would with pancetta. You can use the principal in your day-to-day cooking. Removing moisture will intensify flavour and, in some cases, help with texture. I’ll use curing in a few of my recipes and will give details on each technique here:<br><br>
            Generously – We want to remove a lot of water from something. This is usually done with vegetables, a day or so in advance. We will wash the salt from the food before cooking by submerging it in cold water then drying the food off. To dry food, strain it in a colander then place the ingredient in the centre of a tea towel. Lift up all the corners of the tea towel then lift it off the counter. Spin the towel around like the ingredients are on some sort of fairground ride. The water will spray everywhere, so do it outside! You can use a salad spinner but they’re pointless outside of a large kitchen operation.<br><br>
            Lightly – Sprinkle all over with enough salt to season then place in the fridge on a plate. After a few hours, you will notice a water build up on the plate. Discard this, and pat your ingredient dry before continuing. This is usually done with fish. If your fish has skin, this will help get it really crispy.

            CLEANING MOLLUSCS<br><br>
            
            Scrape off any of the small limpets that may be living on the outer shell with a knife. Use the knife to trim away any “beards”.<br><br>
            Molluscs can often be full of dirt. The way to combat this is to give them time to clean themselves. In a large container, big enough to hold your mussels/clams, chuck a generous amount of sea salt. Pour over just enough boiling water to dissolve the salt. Top up the container with enough cold tap water to submerge your shellfish before putting them all in the salty water. We are simulating sea water here which will lull our soon-to-be dinner in to a false sense of security.<br><br>
            Any that are cracked, floating, or don’t “flinch” when squeezed, chuck in the bin.<br><br>
            Sprinkle some corn flour straight in to the water, around the mussels/clams. Cover the container with a damp cloth, and leave somewhere dark and cold where they won’t be disturbed. The fridge is best. They will open their shells thinking they’re in the sea and will feed on the cornflour.<br><br>
            After about 4 hours, they will have unknowingly cleaned themselves, emptying their shells of any sand/dirt when eating the cornflour. One thing I do is place a grill rack or similar at the bottom of the container to hold the molluscs up so the sand falls to the bottom, but this is not essential.<br><br>
            It is important that molluscs are not kept in water or a sealed container, where they’ll eventually suffocate. Buy them at the last possible convenience and, when storing them, keep them in a container but off the bottom, so there is a gap below them where their poo and wee can gather. I normally put them in a very hole-y colander, which I then place in a bowl. I place a damp tea towel on top of them, and keep them in the fridge. If you are keeping them for more than a day, make sure to wash them daily, empty any liquid out of the bottom container, and keep the tea towel damp. This way you can actually keep molluscs alive for a few days, but make sure to give them the squeeze or float test just before cooking.

            VINAIGRETTE<br><br>

            1 small banana shallot per person<br>
            Peppercorns<br>
            Lemon<br>
            White wine vinegar<br>
            10g. Dijon mustard per person<br>
            Olive oil<br><br>

            Slice your shallots and put them in a small saucepan with a few peppercorns and a lemon peel or two. Add enough white wine vinegar to cover the shallots and bring it to the boil. As soon as it boils, take it off the heat and leave it to infuse for a couple of hours.<br><br>
            After it has cooled, strain it and discard the shallots, peppercorns, and lemon. To the vinegar, add Dijon mustard, and about 3x the amount olive oil to vinegar. You can use extra olive oil, but make sure no more than about ¼ the vinaigrette consists of extra virgin olive oil. It is over-powering. Plain olive oil is preferable. Give the vinaigrette a stir and taste it. If it’s too acidic, add a splash more oil.

            JUS<br><br>

            1kg chicken scraps (bones, skin, wing tips)<br>
            1 carrot, chopped<br>
            1 leek, chopped<br>
            1 onion, chopped<br>
            ½ head of celery, chopped<br>
            Small bunch thyme<br>
            50g tomato paste<br><br>

            If you get more chicken scraps, just weigh it and multiply the other ingredients appropriately.<br><br>
            Put the chicken in a pan and cover with cold water. Put a lid, and get it on a high heat.<br><br>
            Chop all your vegetables and place in an oven-proof dish with a little cooking oil. Put them in a pre-heated oven at around 200 C. After half an hour, take it out of the oven and mix in the tomato paste and thyme. But it back in the oven for 15 minutes.<br><br>
            When the chicken starts boiling, reduce the heat and allow to go to a gentle simmer. Skim any scum then add the vegetables.<br><br>
            Simmer for two hours, then strain the mixture. The finer the strainer, the better. I use muslin cloth. A clean tea towel is good too. Discard the bones and veg.<br><br>
            Put the liquid back on the heat. Reduce slowly over a low heat, skimming and discarding any fat, until it sticks to the back of a spoon. Make batches of this, and keep it in the freezer. I keep it in ice cube trays and use it like stock cubes.

        TOMATO SAUCE<br><br>

        6 tins plum tomatoes<br>
        1 small white onion<br>
        250g butter<br><br>

        Add all the ingredients to a large pan. Rinse out the tins with a little water and add this to the pan too. Bring it to a simmer, then drop the heat so it is barely bubbling. The trick here is too cook the acidity out of the tomatoes.<br><br>
        I usually leave this for at least 3 hours, stirring and checking that it isn’t sticking every hour or so. If it is a bit thick, add a splash of water.<br><br>
        When it has been cooking for at least 3 hours, blend it. Allow it to cool, then batch freeze it. You won’t believe how good this sauce is. It is seen as a standard amongst (mostly old-school) Italian cooks. It can be used for soups, pizzas, ragouts, or <a href="autumnveg.html" style="text-decoration: none; color: rgb(248, 165, 134);">*this beautiful autumn caponata*</a>.
