            MUSSELS, WITH LEEKS AND CIDER<br><br>
            
            500g <a href="tips.html" style="text-decoration: none; color: rgb(248, 165, 134);">*cleaned mussels*</a> per person<br>
            ½ small leek per person<br>
            1 clove garlic per person<br>
            Small pinch fennel seeds<br>
            Small pinch fresh thyme leaves<br>
            200ml dry cider<br><br>

            Clean your mussels. I recommend cooking 2 portions at a time here, to prevent the pan getting too cold when you put the mussels in, otherwise they will take too long to cook and go rubbery.<br><br>
            Put your cider in a small pan and bring it to the boil. Introducing the boiling cider to the mussels will speed up cooking. Slice the leek and garlic, it doesn’t have to be fancy.<br><br>
            Place a knob of butter and a few fennel seeds in a decent-sized pan. Put over a medium heat. When the butter is melted, add your leek, garlic, and picked thyme leaves. If you are cooking 2 portions of mussels at a time, put only two portions-worth of these ingredients. Sweat for a couple of minutes until the leeks are soft, stirring regularly.<br><br>
            Get the heat up HIGH. When it’s hot, add your mussels. Put a lid on top, and shake it around a bit. Leave it on the high heat for a minute, shaking regularly. Add some boiling cider and shake it around for another 2/3 of minutes, until all the mussels have opened. At this point season and empty the pan in to a colander with a container underneath to catch the liquid.<br><br>
            Repeat this process until the mussels are all cooked. When you’ve done your last batch of mussels, get the pan really hot. Add the cooking liquid and any remaining hot cider. Reduce it to the desired consistency, and stir in a generous knob of butter.<br><br>
            I like to portion the mussels in to large bowls, pour over the sauce, and serve with brown bread. Put a big bowl in the middle of the table for the shells.

            PAN-ROASTED SALMON, WITH ASPARAGUS AND SHALLOT VINAIGRETTE<br><br>

            1 fillet salmon per person<br>
            5 fat/10 skinny spears asparagus per person<br>
            <a href="tips.html" style="text-decoration: none; color: rgb(248, 165, 134);">*Shallot vinaigrette*</a><br><br>

            Lightly cure the salmon fillets and leave in the fridge for a few hours.<br><br>
            Snap the bottoms off the asparagus. Snapping them will result in a natural break, where the fibrous bottom meets the tender stem. Discard the bottoms.<br><br>
            Drop the stems in boiling salted water for 2-4 minutes, depending on how fat they are. Scoop them out of the water and drop them in to ice water to instantly chill them. Take them out of the water and keep to one side. If you prefer to eat hot asparagus, you can cook it just before the salmon, but I do it ahead of time as I like the contrast of hot salmon with cold asparagus.<br><br>
            Get a frying pan/griddle hot. Pat the salmon dry and coat it in cooking oil. Put it skin side down in the pan, remembering to place them away from you so you don’t splash hot oil over your hand, then drop to a medium heat. The cooking time will vary depending on the cut of fish, but if they’re about 3cm thick, give them 4 minutes on the skin side, and 1 one the flesh.<br><br>
            Place your asparagus in a bowl with the vinaigrette. Chuck in some salt and pepper, and toss. Serve the salmon fillet on top of the asparagus, and spoon any left-over vinaigrette over to salmon. It’s great with a simple leafy salad.
